# Summary

This repository contains all ressources and documents relative to [this Web App (click here to see it)](https://anvil.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictor/).

My goal was to familiarize myself with natural language processing and use it to build a "next word" predictive model such as the ones we have on our smartphones keyboards. For that, I used a database provided by SwiftKey. 

You will find [here](https://rpubs.com/Anvil/NWP) a complete step-by-step description of how I created the app.
